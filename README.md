# Verifiable Science on Modified PCR Machine

Scientific fraud kills. At Duke, 117 cancer patients received wrong treatments due to fabricated data. At Harvard, fake cardiac stem cell research led to years of invalid clinical trials. At Brigham and Women's, fictional pain studies changed treatment protocols nationwide.

These aren't isolated incidents. They represent a systemic problem: in biomedicine, there's currently no way to verify that published experimental results match the raw data from lab instruments.

## Solving The Problem (We Hope)

We set out to take a widely-used piece of scientific equipment and make its results cryptographically verifiable, preventing result falsification. We chose PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) machines - the workhorses of molecular biology that detect DNA sequences in samples, used in everything from COVID testing to cancer research. By adding cryptographic signing directly to the instrument, results can't be altered after they're generated.

Think of it as a digital notary for your PCR machine - once a result is signed, it can't be altered without detection.

## The Horrific Technical Struggle

Scientific equipment is notoriously difficult to modify. The ThermoFisher 7500 Fast runs on Windows XP with proprietary drivers, and rewriting firmware risks damaging a $25,000 machine's precise thermal control and optical systems. Our solution: we virtualized the Windows XP environment, adding a cryptographic signature request passthrough and carefully wrapping the original software. This lets us securely sign results without touching the core PCR functionality.

### Key Security Features
* Cryptographic signing of all test results via the Zymbit secure element
* Tamper-evident resin seals on all connections and access points
* Any attempts to open or modify the machine result in visible damage to security seals
* Secure boot and runtime attestation of the control software

### The (Minor) Catch
The system is designed for use in supervised laboratory environments where sample chain of custody is maintained. While the machine can't prevent sample swapping before testing, it ensures that once a sample is tested, the results cannot be manipulated.

Future versions will incorporate sample ID verification and process recording, reducing the risk of sample swapping or improper measurement procedures.

## Toward Verifiable Science

This project is a first step toward a future where scientific results are cryptographically verifiable from instrument to publication. Imagine:

* Mass spectrometers that sign their molecular weight measurements
* DNA sequencers that produce verifiable genome data
* Clinical trial data that can be traced back to original instruments
* Journals that require cryptographic proof of raw data

![Yes, It Does Work!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a18538e-97b4-49e6-992a-efa706f72792)
![No Known Issues!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f4ead3-e360-4dd7-8f75-377e7d903ac1)

By starting with PCR - one of the most widely used and frequently manipulated techniques in biology - we're creating a template for how other scientific instruments can be modified to produce trustworthy, verifiable data.

### Modified ThermoFisher Scientific 7500 Fast
The current implementation modifies a ThermoFisher Scientific 7500 Fast real-time PCR system by integrating a Zymbit secure element.

## System Architecture

This system addresses a fundamental challenge in digital laboratory equipment: how do we ensure that test results haven't been falsified or tampered with?

### Core Security Model

There is a one-way flow of information:

`[PCR Machine] → [Sealed VM Environment] → [Virtual Serial] → [Host System]`

This entire chain of execution occurs in tamper-evident environment.

The integrity of the environment is guaranteed by tamper-evident seals on all connections, and the use of Secure Boot within the Zymbit.

### Data Flow Pipeline

1. **Generation**  
   - PCR tests run within the isolated Windows XP VM
   - Results are generated by unmodified ThermoFisher software
   - The OS is locked-down, has no network access and can't install additional software
   - We're assuming that, in this heavily locked-down setting, the user has no ability to tamper with the results

2. **Transport**  
   - The VM may forward results to the host system via a virtual serial channel
   - The channel is unidirectional: data can only flow out of the VM
   - The data is stored securely in the host, within a protected directory
   - We make use of cgroups and other isolation mechanisms to keep this safe

3. **Attestation**  
   - The host's attestation daemon (`attestation_daemon.py`) receives results
   - Each result is immediately signed (soon using the Zymbit secure element)
   - Signatures are created using Ed25519 public-key cryptography
   - The private key will never the hardware security module

4. **Storage & Access**  
   - Signed results and their signatures are stored in a protected directory
   - Files can only be added, never modified or deleted
   - Results can be verified using the system's public key
   - Access is provided through the read-only SSH account

### Guaranteeing Integrity

1. **Physical Security**  
   The PCR machine and Zymbit module are physically sealed with tamper-evident resin. Any attempt to modify the hardware or inject false signals leaves visible evidence.

2. **Virtualization Barrier**  
   The PCR software runs in a pristine Windows XP environment that:
   - Resets to a known-good state on every boot via Windows SteadyState
   - Has no network access or ability to install additional software
   - Can only communicate results through a single, monitored virtual serial channel
   - Is accessible only through SPICE protocol for direct operation

3. **Cryptographic Attestation**  
   Results follow a one-way path:
   - Generated by the PCR software
   - Transmitted via virtual serial to the host
   - Immediately signed using the Zymbit hardware security module
   - Stored in a write-once, read-many directory

### Access Control

The system enforces strict role separation through three highly-restricted user accounts:

- **SPICE Access** (`7500Fast`)  
  Allows operators to run tests by tunneling the SPICE protocol over SSH. This account:
  - Has no shell access
  - Can only forward the SPICE port
  - Requires key-based authentication

- **Results Reader** (`result_reader`)  
  Provides secure access to signed results via SSH. This account:
  - Has read-only access to the results directory
  - Cannot modify or delete existing results
  - Requires key-based authentication

- **WiFi Configuration** (`wifi_setup`)  
  Allows network setup through a restricted interface. This account:
  - Has no password
  - Can only run the `nmtui` network configuration tool
  - Cannot access any other system functions

## How Do I Build The Raspberry Pi Image?

There's a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) in this repository that you can use to run the update scripts locally.

  - Install [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
  - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - Create a `workspace` directory and place your `input.img` in that
  - Run `task build`

Alternatively, you can also manually run `docker`:
```
docker run --rm --privileged -v $(pwd)/workspace:/CustoPiZer/workspace $(pwd)/zymbit_image/scripts:/CustoPiZer/workspace/scripts ghcr.io/octoprint/custopizer:latest
```

## What's Next?

* Integration With Our Own CA.
* Cross-Verifying Results Against What Enters The Unit.
* Increasing The Level Of Auditability, Security On Zymbit.
* Hardening The Windows XP Image.
